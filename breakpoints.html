      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>
        CSS breakpoints are points where the website content responds according to the device width.  CSS breakpoints are also called media query breakpoints, which can be set with media queries<sup>2</sup>.
    
        CSS breakpoints allow one to design the best possible layout on all devices for the user.  There are no set breakpoint rules.  However, there are some industry guiding principles<sup>2</sup>.

      <h3>Where to start?</h3>
      <p>
        Designing with a mobile-first or larger device first approach allows one to decide on the necessary breakpoints scaling up, using mid-width, or scaling down, using max-width, based on page content<sup>2</sup>.
    
        Due to the many numbers of devices with varying widths and heights it is common to group devices into five categories: 1) Extra Small, 2) Small, 2) Medium, 4) Large and 5) Extra Large.  Using the right breakpoints provides the user with a truly responsive web experience.  Remember when deciding on what breakpoints to include to take into account one's layout content and the height and width restrictions implemented by individual devices<sup>1</sup>.
