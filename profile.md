### Kathy Lambert
Software Developer | Project Manager | Web Designer 

I am an intellectually curious individual with an insatiable desire to understand.  I utilize my diverse background, experiences, and skills to help me be resourceful, organized and forward-thinking.  I am actively looking for my first developer position post graduating from General Assembly's bootcamp.
